## General info

This repo is a template of an e-commerce website designed and created by yours truly featuring a home page and products page. 

Products can be altered using the django admin interface. Please contact me if there are any problems logging into the admin page.

Navigation is fully functional as can be seen by the demo above. However, the template could be improved by adding functionality to the search button and other essential e-commerce features such as a shopping cart.

Please feel free to fork this project and contribute to it!
